#Pre-Appointment Questionnaire Machine Learning Project
## project-4

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify responses to a pre-appointment questionnaire into different categories or groups based on the symptoms or health issues reported by patients. The goal is to expedite the discovery stage of consultations and provide healthcare providers with a thorough understanding of patients' symptoms and potential risk factors.
