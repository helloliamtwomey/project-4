# Pre-Appointment Questionnaire Machine Learning Project

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify responses to a pre-appointment questionnaire into different categories or groups based on the symptoms or health issues reported by patients. The goal is to expedite the discovery stage of consultations and provide healthcare providers with a thorough understanding of patients' symptoms and potential risk factors.

## Methodology
- Data Collection and Labelling: Collect and label data from pre-appointment questionnaire responses.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, and standardize the input data for effective model training.
- Model Training: Train and evaluate a machine learning model using Python.
- Model Optimization: Optimize the performance of the machine learning model using hyperparameter tuning.
- GitHub Repository: Upload project files and documentation to a GitHub repository and customize the README.
- Testing and Validation: Test and validate the machine learning model on new data.
- Documentation: Document the results and findings of the project.

## Expected Outcomes
1. A machine learning model with classification accuracy of >75% and R-squared of >80.
2. Clear and well-documented evidence of model optimization and performance evaluation.
3. A GitHub repository with all project files and appropriate documentation.

## Background
A pre-appointment questionnaire is a valuable tool that can be used by healthcare providers to gather information from patients before their scheduled appointment. This can expedite the consultation process and help healthcare providers better understand the patient's symptoms and potential risk factors.

In general practice, patients may present with a wide range of symptoms and conditions. Utilizing a pre-appointment questionnaire allows the healthcare provider to gain insights into the patient's health history and potential risk factors, aiding in identifying potential issues that need attention during the consultation.

This project will leverage natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify questionnaire responses into different categories or groups based on reported symptoms or health issues. This will help healthcare providers quickly identify patients at high risk for specific conditions and prioritize their care accordingly.

## Deliverables
1. A machine learning model trained on pre-appointment questionnaire data.
2. Evidence of model optimization and performance evaluation.
3. A GitHub repository with all project files and documentation.
4. A presentation summarizing the project's results and findings.
