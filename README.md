# Pre-Appointment Questionnaire Machine Learning Project

## Objective:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify responses to a pre-appointment questionnaire into different categories or groups based on the symptoms or health issues reported by patients. The goal is to expedite the discovery stage of consultations and provide healthcare providers with a thorough understanding of patients' symptoms and potential risk factors.

## Methodology:
Collect and label data from pre-appointment questionnaire responses.
Clean, normalise, and standardise the input data.
Train and evaluate a machine learning model in Python.
Optimise the performance of the machine learning model using hyper-parameter tuning.
Upload project files and documentation to a GitHub repository and customise README.
Test and validate the machine learning model on new data.
Document the results and findings of the project.

## Expected Outcomes:
A machine learning model with classification accuracy of >75% and R-squared of >80.
Clear and well-documented evidence of model optimisation and performance evaluation.
A GitHub repository with all project files and appropriate documentation.

## Background: 
A pre-appointment questionnaire is a tool that can be used by healthcare providers to gather information from patients before they arrive for their appointment. This can help to expedite the discovery stage of the consultation and ensure that the healthcare provider has a thorough understanding of the patient's symptoms and potential risk factors.

Using a pre-appointment questionnaire can be particularly helpful in the context of a general practice consultation, where patients may be presenting with a wide range of symptoms and conditions. By having patients complete a questionnaire in advance of their appointment, the healthcare provider can gain a better understanding of the patient's health history and potential risk factors, which can help to identify potential issues that may need to be addressed during the consultation.

This project aims to use natural language processing (NLP) to automatically classify the responses in the questionnaire into different categories or groups, based on the symptoms or health issues that the patients report. This could help the healthcare provider to quickly identify patients who may be at high risk for certain conditions and to prioritize their care accordingly.

## Deliverables:
1. A machine learning model trained on pre-appointment questionnaire data.
2. Evidence of model optimisation and performance evaluation.
3. A GitHub repository with all project files and documentation.
4. A presentation summarising the results and findings of the project.
